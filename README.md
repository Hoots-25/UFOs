# UFOs

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was to assist Dana to make an in-depth analysis of UFO sigtings that allow users to filter multiple criteria at the same time.

## Results
The improved website allows users to sort through the table by searching for the following criteria:
* Date
* City
* State
* Country
* Shape

Users just need to type their search into the [filter search bars](static/images/filters.png).
Upon clicking away from the search bar or pressing the "Enter" key, the table will automatically update based on the search criteria. Note that users can search using multiple filters simultaneously by filling in multiple criteria fields at once.

[In this example](static/images/data.png), we've searched for UFO sitings with "light" shapes located in the state of california.

## Summary
Once drawback of this design is that users who are not familiar with UFO sitings may not know the best criteria to search for. To improve on this design, we can turn the text fields into dropdown menus with popoulated locations, shapes, and dates. That will allow users to know what data they are constrained to. Another improvement to this search design would be to give users the ability to search date ranges. Currently the design only searches for one date, which may constrain the user too much.
